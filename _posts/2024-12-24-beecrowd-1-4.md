#  Form Implementation Guide

## 1. Frontend Components

###  BEE 1003-Simple Sum
```html
Read two integer values, in this case, the variables A and B. After this, calculate the sum between them and assign it to the variable SOMA. Write the value of this variable.

Input
The input file contains 2 integer numbers.

Output
Print the message "SOMA" with all the capital letters, with a blank space before and after the equal signal followed by the corresponding value to the sum of A and B. Like all the problems, don't forget to print the end of line, otherwise you will receive "Presentation Error"
```

### Solution 
```typescript

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read two integer values
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the sum
        int SOMA = A + B;

        // Print the result in the required format
        System.out.println("SOMA = " + SOMA);

        scanner.close();
    }
}


```
