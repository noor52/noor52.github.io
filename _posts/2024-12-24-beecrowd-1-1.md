#  Form Implementation Guide

## 1. Frontend Components

###  BEE 1001-Extremely Basic
```html
Read 2 variables, named A and B and make the sum of these two variables, assigning its result to the variable X. Print X as shown below. Print endline after the result otherwise you will get “Presentation Error”.

Input
The input file will contain 2 integer numbers.

Output
Print the letter X (uppercase) with a blank space before and after the equal signal followed by the value of X, according to the following example.

Obs.: don't forget the endline after all.
```

### Solution 
```typescript

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read two integers
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the sum
        int X = A + B;

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("X = " + X);

        scanner.close();
    }
}

```
