Output
Print the message "PROD" and PROD according to the following example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal.
```

### Solution 
```typescript

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

## 8. Problem Solving

###  BEE 1011-Sphere
```html

Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius (R) . The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. Consider (assign) for pi the value 3.14159.

Tip: Use (4/3.0) or (4.0/3) in your formula, because some languages (including C++) assume that the division's result between two integers is another integer. :)

Input
The input contains a value of floating point (double precision).

Output
The output must be a message "VOLUME" like the following example with a space before and after the equal signal. The value must be presented with 3 digits after the decimal point.
```

### Solution 
```typescript
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the radius (R) of the sphere
        double radius = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Define the value of pi
        double pi = 3.14159;

        // Calculate the volume of the sphere
        double volume = (4.0 / 3) * pi * Math.pow(radius, 3);

        // Print the result with 3 digits after the decimal point
        System.out.printf("VOLUME = %.3f%n", volume);
