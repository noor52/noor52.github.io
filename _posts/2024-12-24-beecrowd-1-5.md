#  Solution Guide

## 1. Problem Solving

###  BEE 1004-Simple Product
```html
Read two integer values. After this, calculate the product between them and store the result in a variable named PROD. Print the result like the example below. Do not forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”.

Input
The input file contains 2 integer numbers.

Output
Print the message "PROD" and PROD according to the following example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal.
```

### Solution 
```typescript

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read two integer values
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the product
        int PROD = A * B;

        // Print the result in the required format
        System.out.println("PROD = " + PROD);

        scanner.close();
    }
}


```
## 2. Problem Solving

###  BEE 1005-Average 1
```html
Read two floating points' values of double precision A and B, corresponding to two student's grades. After this, calculate the student's average, considering that grade A has weight 3.5 and B has weight 7.5. Each grade can be from zero to ten, always with one digit after the decimal point. Don’t forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”. Don’t forget the space before and after the equal sign.

Input
The input file contains 2 floating points' values with one digit after the decimal point.

Output
Print the message "MEDIA"(average in Portuguese) and the student's average according to the following example, with 5 digits after the decimal point and with a blank space before and after the equal signal.
MEDIA= 3.5+7.5/ (A×3.5)+(B×7.5)
​
 

```

### Solution 
```typescript
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read two floating-point values
        double A = scanner.nextDouble();
        double B = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Define the weights
        double weightA = 3.5;
        double weightB = 7.5;

        // Calculate the weighted average
        double MEDIA = ((A * weightA) + (B * weightB)) / (weightA + weightB);

        // Print the result with the required format
        System.out.printf("MEDIA = %.5f%n", MEDIA);

        scanner.close();
    }
}


```

## 3. Problem Solving

###  BEE 1007-Difference
```html
Read four integer values named A, B, C and D. Calculate and print the difference of product A and B by the product of C and D (A * B - C * D).

Input
The input file contains 4 integer values.

Output
Print DIFERENCA (DIFFERENCE in Portuguese) with all the capital letters, according to the following example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal.
```

### Solution 
```typescript
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read four integer values
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();
        int D = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the difference
        int DIFERENCA = (A * B) - (C * D);

        // Print the result in the required format
        System.out.println("DIFERENCA = " + DIFERENCA);

        scanner.close();
    }
}


```

Don’t forget to print the line's end after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”.
Don’t forget the space before and after the equal signal and after the U$.
Input
The input file contains 2 integer numbers and 1 value of floating point, representing the number, worked hours amount and the amount the employee receives per worked hour.

### Solution 
```typescript
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the employee's number
        int employeeNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Read the number of hours worked in a month
        int workedHours = scanner.nextInt();

        // Read the amount received per hour
        double amountPerHour = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate the salary
        double salary = workedHours * amountPerHour;

        // Print the employee's number and salary with the required format
        System.out.printf("NUMBER = %d%n", employeeNumber);
        System.out.printf("SALARY = U$ %.2f%n", salary);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
## 6. Problem Solving

###  BEE 1009-Salary with Bonus
```html
Make a program that reads a seller's name, his/her fixed salary and the sale's total made by himself/herself in the month (in money). Considering that this seller receives 15% over all products sold, write the final salary (total) of this seller at the end of the month , with two decimal places.

- Don’t forget to print the line's end after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”.

- Don’t forget the blank spaces.

Input
The input file contains a text (employee's first name), and two double precision values, that are the seller's salary and the total value sold by him/her.

Output
Print the seller's total salary, according to the given example.
```

### Solution 
```typescript
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the first product's data (code, quantity, price)
        int code1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int quantity1 = scanner.nextInt();
        double price1 = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Read the second product's data (code, quantity, price)
        int code2 = scanner.nextInt();
        int quantity2 = scanner.nextInt();
        double price2 = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate the total price for both products
        double totalToPay = (quantity1 * price1) + (quantity2 * price2);

        // Print the result with the required format using printf
        System.out.printf("Valor a pagar: R$ %.2f%n", totalToPay);

        scanner.close();
    }
}


```
## 4. Problem Solving

###  BEE 1010-Simple Calculate
```html
In this problem, the task is to read a code of a product 1, the number of units of product 1, the price for one unit of product 1, the code of a product 2, the number of units of product 2 and the price for one unit of product 2. After this, calculate and show the amount to be paid.

Input
The input file contains two lines of data. In each line there will be 3 values: two integers and a floating value with 2 digits after the decimal point.

Output
The output file must be a message like the following example where "Valor a pagar" means Value to Pay. Remember the space after ":" and after "R$" symbol. The value must be presented with 2 digits after the point.
```

### Solution 
```typescript
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the radius of the sphere
        double radius = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Define the value of pi
        double pi = 3.14159;

        // Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula
        double volume = (4.0 / 3) * pi * Math.pow(radius, 3);

        // Print the volume with 3 digits after the decimal point
        System.out.printf("VOLUME = %.3f%n", volume);

        scanner.close();
    }
}


```
## 4. Problem Solving

###  BEE 1011-Sphere
```html

Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius (R) . The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. Consider (assign) for pi the value 3.14159.

Tip: Use (4/3.0) or (4.0/3) in your formula, because some languages (including C++) assume that the division's result between two integers is another integer. :)

Input
The input contains a value of floating point (double precision).

Output
The output must be a message "VOLUME" like the following example with a space before and after the equal signal. The value must be presented with 3 digits after the decimal point.
```

### Solution 
```typescript
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the radius of the sphere
        double radius = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Define the value of pi
        double pi = 3.14159;

        // Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula
        double volume = (4.0 / 3) * pi * Math.pow(radius, 3);

        // Print the volume with 3 digits after the decimal point
        System.out.printf("VOLUME = %.3f%n", volume);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
